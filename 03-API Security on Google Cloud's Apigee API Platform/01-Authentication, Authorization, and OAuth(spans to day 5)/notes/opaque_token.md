### ðŸ”‘ What does "opaque token" mean?

* It's just a **random string** generated by Apigee.
* It has **no information inside** (unlike a JWT, which contains claims like `user_id` or `scope`).
* Apigee stores the token details (like client, user, scopes, expiry) in its internal datastore.
* When a request comes in with the token, Apigee **looks it up in the datastore** to verify it.

### Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer a8f4c1d7e29c4f8aa3
```

* `a8f4c1d7e29c4f8aa3` means nothing to you if you decode it.
* Apigee checks its database:

  ```
  Token: a8f4c1d7e29c4f8aa3
  Client: app-123
  Scopes: read, write
  Expiry: 2025-07-29T10:00:00Z
  ```

### Comparison with JWT

| Opaque Token                    | JWT Token                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Random string                   | Encoded JSON with claims        |
| Stored in Apigee datastore      | Self-contained, no DB lookup    |
| Validation: database lookup     | Validation: verify signature    |
| Can't read user info from token | Can decode token to read claims |

ðŸ’¡ **When to use which?**

* **Opaque tokens** â†’ Good if you want Apigee to fully control token storage and validation.
* **JWT tokens** â†’ Better for microservices or distributed APIs where you donâ€™t want a central lookup.
