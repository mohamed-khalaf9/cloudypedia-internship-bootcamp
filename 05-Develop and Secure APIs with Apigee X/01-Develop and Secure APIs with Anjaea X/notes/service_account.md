## 🔐 What is a Service Account?

A **Service Account** is a **special kind of account used by applications, virtual machines (VMs), or services**—not by humans—to authenticate and access Google Cloud resources securely.

Think of it as a **robot user** that your application uses to access Google Cloud services **on its own behalf**.

## 👤 How is it Different from a User Account?

| Feature             | User Account                   | Service Account                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Belongs to          | A person                       | An app, VM, or service               |
| Authenticates via   | Username & password (or OAuth) | Private key or built-in identity     |
| Used for            | Manual actions via UI/CLI      | Automated tasks (API calls, scripts) |
| Can be added to IAM | ✅                              | ✅                                    |

## 🧠 Why Use a Service Account?

* Automate cloud tasks (e.g., a script that uploads files to Cloud Storage).
* Enable communication between services (e.g., a backend calling a database).
* Assign **only the permissions needed** (Principle of Least Privilege).

---

## 🔧 Example Use Case

Imagine you're building a web app that stores user profile pictures in Google Cloud Storage.

* The app runs on **App Engine**.
* When a user uploads a photo, the app must **write to a Storage bucket**.

🔑 **How does the app get access?**

* You assign a **service account** to the App Engine.
* That service account is given the **"Storage Object Admin"** role.
* Now your app can upload files **securely without exposing your personal credentials**.

## 🔑 Authentication with a Service Account

There are two main ways:

1. **Built-in Service Account**
   If you're running on a Google Cloud service like App Engine, Cloud Run, or GKE, they automatically use a service account (no need to handle keys).

2. **Key-based Authentication**
   If you're running code **outside Google Cloud**, you can:

   * Download a **JSON key file**
   * Use it in your code to authenticate via client libraries or tools like `gcloud`

   ```java
   GoogleCredentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream("key.json"));
   ```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

* Use **built-in service accounts** when possible (easier + more secure).
* Follow **least privilege**—only assign needed roles.
* Rotate or manage keys properly if you're using them.
